# Every Dead End

Every Dead End is an interactive map showing photos of every dead end in LA. This is a project undertaken by Erik Binggeser (@truemarmalade) to raise money for the Los Angeles Bicycle Academy. The web portion of this project was built using Leaflet, Stadia Maps, OpenMapTiles, and OpenStreetMap.
